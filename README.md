My Tableau dashboard for the VGSales database includes several key visualizations:

Top 10 Platforms by Sales using Bubble Graph: This visualization highlights the top 10 gaming platforms by sales volume. Each platform is represented as a bubble, with the size of the bubble corresponding to its total sales, allowing for an easy comparison of platform popularity and market dominance.

Sales by Year According to Genre using Area Chart: This area chart displays sales trends over the years for different game genres. Each genre is represented by a different colored area, showing how sales for each genre have changed over time, which helps in identifying trends and shifts in genre popularity.

Total Sales by Genre using Stacked Column Chart: This chart provides a breakdown of total sales by genre. Each column represents a genre, and the different segments within each column show the contribution of various sub-categories or other relevant breakdowns within the genre. This helps in understanding the overall performance of each genre and its sub-categories.

Additional Visualizations: The dashboard may also include other charts and metrics such as total sales by region, sales performance of top publishers, and forecasts of future sales trends. These additional visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the video game sales data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on various sales dimensions.
